# SEPA QR Code Generator

This is a simple Python script to generate SEPA QR codes for payments. It is based on the [European Payments Council SEPA QR Code Guidelines](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/document-library/guidance-documents/quick-response-code-guidelines-enable-data-capture-initiation).

## TODO

- [ ] Add usage instructions
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add import from CSV/json
- [ ] Separate changeable and unchangeable fields to improve usability with multiple generations with different `remittance_information` (e.g. BIC, IBAN, amount)
- [ ] Try CI/CD (maybe add web interface)
